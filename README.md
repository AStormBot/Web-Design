# Web Disign
Hello! <br>
Web Design Project is easy-to-use designed website for Show Your images <br>
U just only change some text and give some data to data.js <br>
__But You Must Be Front-end Programmer To Use it__ <br>

## How to use
just Follow Steps:
1. Set Your header.
2. open Data.js
3. in project variable add this (I added simple example there) :
```js
{
name: "Your Pic name",
url: "Your Pic path",
pfp: "The creator profile picture",
type: 1 / 2 // 1 = your pic is not horizontal / 2 = your pic is horizontal
}
```

## What's new
- Header has motion
- JQuery Moved to app.js
- Some Bug Fixed
